# VASL Play Aids

## Overview

The VASL Play Aids repository contains templates for creating visually pleasing and helpful playing aids for your VASL games. You can find the documentation [here](http://vasl-developers.github.io/playaids/).

## How does it work?

VASL allows you to place HTML fragments next to your boards. This enables you to create pretty much any kind of graphical play aid. Usually these play aids are based on an HTML table.
